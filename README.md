### --> assiging the values in go

var variablename type = "hello" 

variablename := "hello" (we can't explicitly type cast this method)

:= this is called the wallrun operator

### --> assiging multiple values in go
method 1
- variablename1,variablename2 := "hello1" , "hello2"

- variablename1,variablename2 type := "hello1" , "hello2"
(then all variable will be of same type)
